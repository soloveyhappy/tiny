//Usage: SubWCRev WorkingCopyPath [SrcVersionFile DstVersionFile] [-nmdf]
//
//Params:
//WorkingCopyPath    :   path to a Subversion working copy.
//SrcVersionFile     :   path to a template file containing keywords.
//DstVersionFile     :   path to save the resulting parsed file.
//-n                 :   if given, then SubWCRev will error if the working
//                       copy contains local modifications.

//                       copy contains mixed revisions.
//-d                 :   if given, then SubWCRev will only do its job if
//                       DstVersionFile does not exist.
//
//-f                 :   if given, then SubWCRev will include the
//                       last-committed revision of folders. Default is
//                       to use only files to get the revision numbers.

//-e                 :   if given, also include dirs which are included
//                       with svn:externals, but only if they're from the
//                       same repository.

//-x                 :   if given, then SubWCRev will write the revisions
//                       numbers in HEX instead of decimal
//-X                 :   if given, then SubWCRev will write the revisions
//                       numbers in HEX with '0x' before them
//
//Switches must be given in a single argument, e.g. '-nm' not '-n -m'.
//
//SubWCRev reads the Subversion status of all files in a working copy
//excluding externals. If SrcVersionFile is specified, it is scanned
//for special placeholders of the form "$WCxxx$".
//SrcVersionFile is then copied to DstVersionFile but the placeholders
//are replaced with information about the working copy as follows:
//
//$WCREV$      Highest committed revision number
//$WCDATE$     Date of highest committed revision
//$WCDATE=$    Like $WCDATE$ with an added strftime format after the =
//$WCRANGE$    Update revision range
//$WCURL$      Repository URL of the working copy
//$WCNOW$      Current system date & time
//$WCNOW=$     Like $WCNOW$ with an added strftime format after the =
//
//Placeholders of the form "$WCxxx?TrueText:FalseText$" are replaced with
//TrueText if the tested condition is true, and FalseText if false.
//
//$WCMODS$     True if local modifications found
//$WCMIXED$    True if mixed update revisions found
//
//The strftime format strings for $WCDATE=$ & $WCNOW=$ must not be longer
//than 64 characters, and must not produce output greater than 128 characters.
